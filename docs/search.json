Follow along as I embark on this interesting project to analyze user demographics and establish criteria for insurance policies (products).\n\n\nTo start off, here is a brief introduction about myself. My name is Doah Kim, a penultimate studying Economics at NUS. I’m also taking up Chinese language and Communications and New Media as a minor. As you might have guessed, I am interested in a lot of things. I am particularly interested in how I can contribute to a wider range of people with the work I do. I like to explore the world around me, and I’m a peoples person who loves to interact with those around me. More from my background, I am from Korea, lived in Singapore during my elementary school years, and came back for my study in university. Some of my hobbies are rock climbing, café-hopping, and watching dramas!\n\n\n\nIn today’s rapidly evolving financial landscape, the ability to accurately assess and manage loan sanctions is more critical than ever for financial institutions. This website aims to delve into the intricate relationships between demographic factors and loan sanction amounts, leveraging extensive data from our two primary datasets: customer segmentation and loan sanction records. This analysis is not just about numbers; it’s about understanding the people behind these numbers—their backgrounds, behaviors, and financial needs.\nFinancial inclusivity and risk management are at the heart of modern banking practices.By examining how variables such as age, gender, income level, and employment status influence loan amounts, we can uncover valuable insights that help financial institutions refine their risk assessment models and tailor their products to meet the diverse needs of their clientele. Such targeted analytics not only boost the profitability of banks by reducing default rates but also enhance customer satisfaction by providing more personalized financial solutions.\nThis project is driven by a broader aim to contribute to economic stability and growth.
