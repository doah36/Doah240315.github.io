# Welcome to my website :)

Hello! I hope your day is going well for you. There isn't much here yet, but follow along as I develop on this workspace!

## Self-Introduction

To start off, here is a brief introduction about myself. My name is Doah Kim, a penultimate studying Economics at NUS. I'm also taking up Chinese language and Communications and New Media as a minor. As you might have guessed, I am interested in a lot of things. I like to explore the world around me, and I'm a peoples person who loves to interact with those around me. More from my background, I am from Korea, lived in Singapore during my elementary school years, and came back for my study in university. Some of my hobbies are rock climbing, caf√©-hopping, and watching dramas !

## Datasets for My Project

I have currently identified 2 datasets for my project.

\(1\) customer_segmentation_data

Contains: Loan_ID, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area

\(2\) loan_sanction_test

Contains: Customer ID, Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education Level, Geographic Information, Occupation, Income Level, Behavioral Data, Purchase History, Interactions with Customer Service,Insurance Products Owned, Coverage Amount, Premium Amount, Policy Type, Customer Preferences, Preferred Communication Channel, Preferred Contact Time, Preferred Language, Segmentation Group

I plan to classify the loan types into segments 1\~5 (in dataset 1) based on a certain established criteria and link them to dataset (2) to analyze the relationships.
